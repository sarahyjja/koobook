# KOOBOOK

Create an application that allows you to use the Google Books API to search for books, and deploy it somewhere that we can access through a web browser.



## Core features

- [x] - Type in a query and display a list of books matching that query

- [x] - Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book

- [x] - From each list item, you should also be able to :
    - [x] - Navigate to more information about the book (this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application)
    - [x] - Link out to an external site with more information about that particular book

- [x] - Deploy to Heroku



## Getting started
To run the app locally, please, follow the instructions:

### Prerequisites
- node.js
- npm

### Installing
1 - Start to clone the repository from GitHub ([need a help?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O72FWNeO-xY))

2 - Make sure that `node.js` and `npm` are installed on your computer. Run `node -v` and `npm -v` to be sure and to know their versions. You will be alright to continue if the `node.js` version start with "10.x" and `npm` with "6.x".

- If not, please [update](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6237295/how-can-i-update-nodejs-and-npm-to-the-next-versions) your versions in writing `npm update -g`
- Otherwise: download [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) / `npm install`

### The files
To make any changes, you will need to navigate in between 3 files:
- `index.html`
- `index.js`
- `style.css`
Save your changes and see them when you run `index.html` in your browser.
